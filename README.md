<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# StreamRAG: GPT-Powered Video Retrieval & Streaming 🚀

## What does it do? 🤔

It enables developers to:

* 📚 Upload multiple videos to create a library or collection.
* 🔍 Search across these videos and get real-time video responses or compilations.
* 🛒 Publish your searchable collection on the ChatGPT store.
* 📝 Receive summarized text answers (RAG).
* 🌟 Gain key insights from specific videos (e.g. "_Top points from  episode 31_").

## How do I use it? 🛠️

- **Get your API key:** Sign up on [VideoDB console](https://console.videodb.io) (Free for the first 50 uploads, no
  credit card required). 🆓
- **Set `VIDEO_DB_API_KEY`:** Enter your key in the `env` file.
- **Install dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
- **Upload your collection to VideoDB:** Add your links in `upload.py`.
- **Run locally:** Start the flask server with `python app.py`.

## Publishing on ChatGPT Store 🏪

1. Deploy your flask server and note your server's `url`. For instance, you can use our public MoZ podcast server (
   replace with your Spext server details).
2. In `openapi.yaml`, update the `url` field under `server`.
3. Visit the GPT builder at https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor
4. In the configure tab, add your GPT's `Name` and `Description`.
5. Copy the prompt from `prompts.txt` into the `Instructions` field. Feel free to modify it as needed. ✏️
6. Click on `Create new Action`
7. Copy the openapi details from `openapi.yaml` Don't miss to update the `url` field.
8. Save your GPT for personal use and give it a test run! 🧪
